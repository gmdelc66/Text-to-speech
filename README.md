# Text-to-speech
Text to speech GUI convertor using Tkinter in Python

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.By this library we can make a compelling choice for building GUI applications in Python, especially for applications where a modern sheen is unnecessary, and the top priority is to build something that’s functional and cross-platform quickly.

To create a tkinter application:

        Importing the module – tkinter
        Create the main window (container)
        Add any number of widgets to the main window
        Apply the event Trigger on the widgets.

Now, Let’s create a GUI based Text to speech convertor application which convert text into speech.

There are lots of library in python one of them is gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate’s text-to-speech API.  


To install gTTS simply go to your terminal and type:

pip install gTTS

Below is the implementation :
